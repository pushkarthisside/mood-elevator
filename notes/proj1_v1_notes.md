proj1 - version 1 ideation

so there will be basically 2 accessible pages - the first one will be the one which asks how u feeling, the second will be the exact mood

there will be a home button on both pages - which when pressed returns to the home page



HOMEPaGE

This will be the home page, a gradient of orange. and in middle itll ask - How do u feel right now... and then there will be the boxes of the moods, when a person clicks

the page goes into into the *mood page.* It'll contain modern ui, and a background like gradient of orange - warm and vibrant hues. 
The buttons will be like a modern ui


MoodPage

the mood page wilol contain a line "Here’s your quote....I hope you feel better." a quote box - where quote will be displayed
and another box/ or more like color gradient which shows the interpretation of the quote (what it means) and 1 motivating line like "you can do it etc"
below the interpretation box there will be 2 boxes - exit nd another one

exit makes u go back at home page and another one shows another quote of the same mood category

this is my base aim , there will be home butoon on corner on both of the pages and the credits buttion on far corner small about me(the dev) and my links. like thell press and go into another page(not the same)


this is my idea only, now lets decide on mood after u lock in this part (also add any sugguestion if u have)


i want more than 5 moods honestly - i want sad, lonely/empty, overwhelmed, unfocused, anxious, ready to grind, bad urges, want inspiration, beast mode

and each set must have around 10 quotes + explanation , so any db required?
